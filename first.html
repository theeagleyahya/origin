	hello hi
	<p>For some reason, people love lists: Best (and Worst) Dressed lists, Top Ten lists,
My All-Time Favorite X lists, where X is whatever you want it to be: movies, songs,
books, I Love Lucy episodes — you name it. People like lists, for whatever reasons.
Okay, so let’s make some lists. Easy, right? Well, sure, any website jockey can just
plop a Best Tootsie Roll Flavors Ever list on a page by typing each item, one after
the other. Perhaps our list maker even gets a bit clever and inserts the <br> tag
between each item, which displays them on separate lines. Ooooh.
Yes, you can make a list that way, and it works well enough, I suppose, but there’s
a better way. HTML has a few tags that are specially designed to give you much
more control over your list-building chores. For example, you can create a bulleted
list that actually has those little bullets out front of each item. Nice! Want a
Top Ten list, instead? HTML has your back by offering special tags for numbered
		
		
		
		hjjhh
lists, too.</p>
